            <h2>Online Movie Ticket Booking System</h2>
            <p>The Online Movie Ticket Booking System is like a virtual movie theater where users can easily book tickets, admins manage movie information, and theater staff organize screenings.</p>
            <p><strong>User Panel (For Users):</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Users provide their personal details to register, such as creating a username, password, and entering their email address. When booking tickets, they input preferences like selecting which movie they want to watch, the showtime, the number of tickets they want to buy, and entering their payment information securely.</p>
            <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Once a booking is confirmed, users receive detailed confirmations via email. These confirmations include information like the movie title, showtime, seat numbers, and a booking reference number for reference. Additionally, users can view their booking history within their account to keep track of past movie experiences.</p>

            <h2>Client-Server Architecture Using OpenGL</h2>
            <p>This project involves developing a client-server application using OpenGL for rendering graphics. It demonstrates how client and server components communicate to provide a real-time graphical experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Clients send requests for graphical data, and the server processes these requests and sends back rendered images.</p>
            <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Clients receive and display rendered graphics in real-time based on the server's processing.</p>

            <h2>Food Donation Application Using Android</h2>
            <p>This project involves creating an Android application to minimize food wastage by enabling donations of excess food and money to organizations and the needy.</p>
            <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Users can register, provide details about excess food, and select preferences for donation. They can also make monetary donations.</p>
            <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Users receive confirmation of their donation and can view their donation history. The system updates the available food items and donation records.</p>

            <h2>Chronic Kidney Diseases Prediction and Diet Plan Recommendation Using ML</h2>
            <p>This project predicts chronic kidney disease using machine learning techniques and provides diet recommendations based on the prediction.</p>
            <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Users provide medical data related to kidney health, which is analyzed to predict the risk of chronic kidney disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Users receive a prediction of their kidney health status and diet recommendations to help manage their condition.</p>
